Russian electronic gruop C_File  The depth of my sea is calm: no one knows what kind of monsters it hides. The C file is the key to finding out what the VA has done on behalf of the veteran’s claim and what it has not. The C file will contain any service records, service medical records, current medical records, CP exams and other evidence submitted for the veteran’s claim. Since the C file contains all the information on the claims I ordered my pertinent archive records a month ago and I still have not received them. Also, I ordered my C file around the same time and I still have not received them. What is the typical wait time? One veteran said it took him 19 months. I hope it doesn't take that long, it is important to thoroughly read them for my case. My notice of disagreement is not due until next year. Also, I have the opportunity to reopen my case before that if I get more evidence. We shall see, a lot of it is really. Joshua Rubenstein.

Matthew Bunson. The C programming language provides many standard library functions for file input and output. These functions make up the bulk of the C standard library header . The functionality descends from a "portable I/O package" written by Mike Lesk at Bell Labs in the early 1970s "Strictly speaking, in C the FILE type is a library defined (in stdio.h header) type alias (see typedef keyword). No need to use FILE type as such, only FILE (pointer to FILE) type. It's (one of;) C language funny idioms.

Hey everyone, this probably is a stupid question, but I don't get it even after looking into it for way to long. I know you can also include \ c files, but this is rarely done. So my question is, why are there header files, when they just contains the function declarations. Somewhere in the four-stage-process the actual function has to be included, right? Somewhere implicit the definition must come from, so we have to deal with that \ c-file anyway. Now from my perspective, header files. Jack Koumi.
